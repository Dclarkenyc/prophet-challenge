#prophet-challenge
## 
### Description:
The assignment was to find unusual patterns in Google's traffic by connecting
traffic to corporate financial events.  First mining the data for seasonality 
then relating search traffic to stock prices and finally by 
creating a time series model with prophet.

### Usage:
Run the file forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb

### Resources:
The completed assignment is in the folder prophet-challenge in the file
forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb. 

### Known Issues:  
Had numerous technical difficulties with prophet and had to reload python but 
it seems to work now.  Also I did it in Colab but could not get it to Save 
a Copy in GitHub so downloaded as ipynb and added to GitHub.
### Acknowledgements:
I leaned heavily on Xpert Learning Assitant to help with the Prophet questions.
